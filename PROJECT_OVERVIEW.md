## 1️⃣ Problem Statement

### The Crisis in Indian Handicrafts

**Market Size & Opportunity:**
- India's handicraft sector employs **7 million artisans** (68% women)
- Worth **$3.5 billion** in annual exports
- **87% of artisans earn below minimum wage** due to exploitative middleman networks

**The Middleman Problem:**
- Export supply chain involves **4-7 intermediaries**
- Each intermediary takes **20-40% margins**
- Artisans receive only **12-18% of final retail prices**
- Example: A $100 Pashmina shawl in NYC gives the artisan just $12-18

**Key Artisan Clusters:**
- **Rajasthan:** Block printing, tie-dye
- **West Bengal:** Kantha embroidery
- **Kashmir:** Pashmina weaving
- **Odisha:** Silver filigree
- **Varanasi:** Silk weaving
- **Jaipur:** Block printing
- **Kanchipuram:** Silk sarees

### Critical Barriers to Direct Export

1. **Language Barriers:** Artisans lack English skills for international B2B communication
2. **Quality Standardization:** No knowledge of export market quality requirements
3. **Digital Payment Infrastructure:** Limited access to international payment systems
4. **Logistics Complexity:** Small-batch international shipping is prohibitively expensive
5. **Documentation Burden:** Export paperwork (customs, certifications) is overwhelming

### Market Gaps

**Existing platforms fail artisans:**
- **Amazon Karigar:** Charges 15-25% fees, doesn't solve language/quality barriers
- **Etsy:** Too generic, no B2B focus, no cultural context
- **IndiaMART:** B2B industrial, not handicraft-focused
- **Government GeM:** Domestic procurement only

**Global Demand Surge:**
- Ethical, handmade product demand grew **340% since 2020** (McKinsey)
- Indian artisans can't capitalize due to systemic barriers

---

## 2️⃣ Target Audience

### Primary: Indian Artisan Clusters
- **7 million handicraft artisans** across India

- Average current income: ₹8,000-15,000/month ($100-180)

### Secondary: Global Ethical Buyers
- **50,000+ boutique buyers** worldwide
- Interior designers, ethical fashion brands, specialty retailers
- Key markets: US, EU, Australia, Japan
