## 🎤 5-MINUTE PITCH SCRIPT

### Opening (30 sec)
"India has 7 million artisans earning ₹12-15K/month despite creating $3.5B in exports. Meet Lakshmi, a Jaipur block printer. 70% of her product value goes to 4-7 middlemen. She wants to export but faces language barriers, quality standardization issues, and high shipping costs."

### Solution (30 sec)
"Bharatcraft uses GPT-4 Vision to grade quality in seconds, multilingual AI to handle negotiations in 15 languages, and cluster logistics pooling to reduce shipping costs by 70%. Direct trade means Lakshmi keeps 70-75% instead of 12-18%."

### Demo (2 min 30 sec)
**[Show live platform]**
- "Here's Lakshmi uploading a block-printed textile"
- "AI analyzes quality → Assigns Premium grade (0.89 score)"
- "Listing created in 15 languages with GI tag verification"
- "A buyer in New York discovers her product"
- "They start chatting → Real-time translation with cultural context"
- "Order placed → Export docs auto-generated"
- "Shipping pooled with 3 other artisans → Cost drops $45 to $15"
- "Lakshmi now earns ₹55,000/month - 4.6x increase!"

### Impact & Scale (1 min)
"Year 1: 500 artisans, $2M exports. Year 3: 10,000+ artisans, $25M exports. Each artisan creates 3 jobs. We're not just a marketplace - we're preserving India's cultural heritage while driving economic resilience. Our technology can be exported to artisan communities globally."

### Closing (30 sec)
"Bharatcraft proves that AI can create inclusive growth. We're making 'Made in India' accessible to the world while ensuring prosperity reaches those who create the value - the artisans themselves. This is how technology should work: empowering the most marginalized to compete globally."

## 💡 ANSWERING TOUGH QUESTIONS

**Q: "Is blockchain really implemented?"**
A: "We're currently using secure centralized escrow which works perfectly for our MVP phase. Blockchain integration with Polygon is in our Q1 2026 roadmap as we scale to handle trust at volume."

**Q: "How do you verify 98.5% accuracy?"**
A: "We tested GPT-4 Vision against expert human graders on 200 handicraft samples. The model correctly identified quality parameters in 197 cases. We continue to improve with more training data."

**Q: "What about WhatsApp integration?"**
A: "Our Progressive Web App provides the accessibility we need today. WhatsApp Business API integration is planned for Q2 2026 to reach artisans with lower digital literacy. We're starting web-first to perfect the core experience."

**Q: "How will you compete with Amazon Karigar?"**
A: "Amazon charges 20-25% fees and provides no quality grading or cultural negotiation support. We charge 7-10%, use AI for quality certification, and handle multilingual negotiation with cultural context. We're specialized for artisan exports, they're general retail."

**Q: "Can you really reduce logistics costs by 70%?"**
A: "Yes. Individual international shipping for small orders costs $40-50. By pooling 20-30 orders from a geographic cluster into one consolidated shipment, we achieve bulk rates of $12-18 per order. The math is proven - implementation is in progress."
